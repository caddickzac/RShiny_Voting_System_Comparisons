# RShiny_Voting_System_Comparisons

** This is currently still being worked on. 

I created an RShiny app for comparing voting systems using simulated data. 
* Four voting sytems are compared (plurality, Cardinal, Ranked-Choice, & approval). 
* Up to 20 candidates and 500 voters can be simulated. 
* The RShiny tool allows users to investigate how competing voting systems use varying mechanisms for choosing electoral winners.
